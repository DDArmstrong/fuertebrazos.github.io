<p>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS</p>
<h3>The secret language of dating profiles</<h3>
<h2>BY DAN ARMSTRONG</h2>

<p>Skills: Python, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit),SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, Pandas, Datawrapper</p>

<p>I wanted to see whether I could predict the characteristics of men and women on dating sites by applying sentiment analysis to their profiles.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles">Kaggle</a> has posted an anonymized dataset of about 60,000 OK Cupid profiles scraped from a Bay Area IP address. I pulled the data into Pandas and explored the demographics, including age, sexual orientation, height, body type, diet, income, education, religion, ethnicity, and use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco.</p>

<p>I also pulled together everything that each person had written about himself or herself and wrote a Python program to analyze it using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, an NLTK library that scores the text’s positivity or negativity.</p>

<p>Some surprising results:</p>

<p>People who wrote a lot about themselves tended to have high negatives - over three times the level of their positives.</p>
<p>People who wrote a lot, besides being more negative, tended to use a lot of “I” statements (self-directed) relative to the number of “you” statements (other-directed).</p>
<p>The older the prospective dater, the more positive the sentiment.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more, including clues to drinking and drug habits (even if they aren’t directly disclosed in the profile).</p>
