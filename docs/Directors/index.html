I obtained a list of companies in the Russell 3,000 - the top 3,000 US public companies by capitalization - and discovered that Reuters maintains company pages listing each director, their age, position, and when they were appointed to the board.</p> <p>I built a scraper and went to work. The result was a dataset of about 45,000 names - and quite a few surprises:</p> <p>The youngest public company CEO in America, who started his company at 19 and now runs a vaping empire.</p> <p>A 99-year-old CEO, WWII airman, Harvard degree in math and physics, son of a Lebanese coal miner.</p> <p>By ranking names by how often they appeared, I compiled a group of men who built their careers at one company - Liberty Media - and went on to serve on many other boards.</p> <p>I call this group of board members the John Malone Mafia because they were all mentored by the cable media entrepreneur John Malone.</p> <p>Methodology:</p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>Ticker list from ftserussell.com.</p> <p>Board members from the “company people” pages at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1628727394780000&usg=AOvVaw3fBj57IaOSECRPjjbx0sfA">https://www.reuters.com</a>.</p> <p>Scraper built with Python’s BeautifulSoup library to pull board members from each company’s Reuters page.</p> <p>Data analyzed using Pandas.</p> <p>Github_repo: The code is available at https://github.com/fuertebrazos/directors</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-smHYKdLADwkXOn1EmN1qk/HfnUcbVRZyYmZ4qpPea6sjB/pTJ0euyQp0Mk8ck+5T" crossorigin></script> </body></html>
