<p>I wanted to see whether I could predict the characteristics of men and women on dating sites by applying sentiment analysis to their profiles.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1628271318828000&usg=AOvVaw1KCh3PM30k0gcj-mBGZZAd">https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles</a>, Kaggle has posted an anonymized dataset of about 60,000 OK Cupid profiles scraped from a Bay Area IP address. I pulled the data into Pandas and explored the demographics, including age, sexual orientation, height, body type, diet, income, education, religion, ethnicity, and use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco.</p><p>I also pulled together everything that each person had written about himself or herself and wrote a Python program to analyze it using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, an NLTK library that scores the text’s positivity or negativity.</p><p>Some surprising results:</p><ul> <li>People who wrote a lot about themselves tended to have high negatives - over three times the level of their positives.People who wrote a lot, besides being more negative, tended to use a lot of “I” statements (self-directed) relative to the number of “you” statements (other-directed).The older the prospective dater, the more positive the sentiment.</li> </ul><p>There’s a lot more, including clues to drinking and drug habits (even if they aren’t directly disclosed in the profile).</p>
