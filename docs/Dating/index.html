I pulled the data into Pandas and explored the demographics, including age, sexual orientation, height, body type, diet, income, education, religion, ethnicity, and use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco.</p> <p>I also pulled together everything that each person had written about himself or herself and wrote a Python program to analyze it using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, an NLTK library that scores the text’s positivity or negativity.</p> <p>Some surprising results:</p> <ul> <li>People who wrote a lot about themselves tended to have high negatives - over three times the level of their positives.People who wrote a lot, besides being more negative, tended to use a lot of “I” statements (self-directed) relative to the number of “you” statements (other-directed).The older the prospective dater, the more positive the sentiment.</li> </ul> <p>There’s a lot more, including clues to drinking and drug habits (even if they aren’t directly disclosed in the profile).</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-smHYKdLADwkXOn1EmN1qk/HfnUcbVRZyYmZ4qpPea6sjB/pTJ0euyQp0Mk8ck+5T" crossorigin></script> </body></html>
