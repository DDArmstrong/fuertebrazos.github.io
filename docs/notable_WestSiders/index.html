It encompasses Columbia University, borders on Harlem, and is sometimes called the “Upper Upper West Side.” He shared with me his spreadsheet of famous figures in our neighborhood from pre-Revolutionary times to the present.</p> <p>methodology:</p> <p>Methodology</p> <p>I used Geocodio to get the latitude and longitude of the addresses, then dropped them into QGIS and combined them with Census shapefiles.</p> <p>I wrote a Python program to filter the dataset down to people who are sufficiently well-known to have Wikipedia pages.</p> <p>Because QGIS is limited in its ability to utilize drop-down filters, I re-created the map in Tableau, categorized the names by occupation, and gave users the ability to filter residents by the source of their fame.</p> <p>github_repo: Code is available at http://github.com/fuertebrazos/notable_WestSiders</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-smHYKdLADwkXOn1EmN1qk/HfnUcbVRZyYmZ4qpPea6sjB/pTJ0euyQp0Mk8ck+5T" crossorigin></script> </body></html>
